Hello World repository for Git practice.
This is an example repository for Git tutorial. I have learned this before but I haven't been practising it. This is the time to put it into full use.

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial.

My name is Opeyemi Adedotun.
I develop websites and design digital products.
I am having some hard time running a pull request.

I am trying out another method to ensure the pull request works.

Got the pull request to work. Then added some description to the images.
